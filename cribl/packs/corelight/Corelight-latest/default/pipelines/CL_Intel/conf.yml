        Data Format Identification: This function clarifies the data formats
        that are being ingested into the pipeline. The pipeline supports a
        variety of formats, including TSV (Tab-Separated Values), JSON
        (JavaScript Object Notation), Elasticsearch, as well as various agents
        like Splunk UF, Filebeats, and Cribl Edge. Additionally, sources like
        HEC (HTTP Event Collector) and Syslog are also supported.


        It's important to note that the variable Var.log_format() is defined within the Knowledge Base under Global Variables, specifically within the log_format category within this Pack.

        Processing TSV Formatted Data: In scenarios where the ingested data
        follows the TSV (Tab-Separated Values) format, the procedure involves
        extracting all available fields using the CL_Conn parser from the
        Knowledge section within this Pack. It's important to note that the
        effectiveness of this parser is influenced by the manner in which TSV
        headers are transmitted from the Corelight sensor.


        It's advised to meticulously validate both the types and order of fields being received. This validation process enables you to make necessary adjustments to the existing parser (CL_Conn), such as adding, removing, or reordering fields. This ensures that the parser accurately interprets the TSV data and facilitates seamless downstream processing.

        VERY IMPORTANT:

        Given the nature of intel.log being focused on threat intelligence, many of its fields are generally considered critical for full context and understanding. Therefore, exercise caution when opting to remove any fields.


        The decision on which fields to remove largely depends on the use case, investigative needs, and the specific environment. We can make some general recommendations for fields that might be considered "less critical" in a typical environment and could potentially be safely removed for data reduction purposes. Keep in mind, these are suggestions, and you should review and confirm based on your own requirements and validate with your team.

        Cleanup Functions and Serialization:

        In the cleanup phase, the serialization process determines the fields that are retained within the `_raw` field. This decision influences the event size, contingent on the number of fields retained or removed, as well as the chosen serialization method. The serialization options include JSON, Key-Value Pair, and CSV formats. The selection of serialization type impacts the data structure and, subsequently, the overall size of the event. 

        Careful consideration is advised to strike a balance between event comprehensiveness and efficient data storage.
